Wow. Just... wow. I'm completely blown away. When Life Gives You Tangerines—what a rollercoaster. My mind is still kind of like, a jigsaw puzzle tossed into the air, all pieces scattered around me. You know how theaters are—sticky floors, my back's practically folded in half like an origami crane, but who cares? That  ... it's like if a jazz concert and a circus got together and had a baby, then that baby grew up to be a rebellious poet.

The scenes are still swirling around in my head like bits of color in a kaleidoscope. Some moments, goodness, they were so vivid that they kinda clang to me like static electricity. Remember that bit when she's peeling a tangerine and the juice is all like sunshine dripping from her fingers? I'm not even sure if the citrus was a metaphor for life or just breakfast.

> The popcorn, my god, everywhere... it's in my lap and somehow there's a piece stuck in my jacket pocket from last winter's rush. That's like the whole 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 too. It surprises you in places you didn't even know exist, like that kid's magic show where he pulls a rabbit out of his belly button, what a weird quantum magic trick—definitely not in the brochure.

And as if reminded by the sticky note my brain must have left for me—someone mentioned 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   or something. Honestly, it feels more like a thing to be experienced than 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥. A warning for anyone planning to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 this  : It’s not something you just look at. You binge it with your soul. Like drinking from a fire hydrant.

Remember Lisa? She asked about that 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   thing... I should text her back but I'm pretty sure the   just erased any intentions of coherent follow-up. It's left me thinking about all the moments that pass us by like whispering shadows, here and gone, and suddenly you’re sitting dumbfounded on a stranger’s park bench.

Sorry, hold on, I just accidentally typed this here—but doesn’t it feel good? Like, bizarrely poetic:
```python
if hummingbird == 'cloud':
    tangerine.dream(whisper=True)
```
Or maybe I just need to sleep.
